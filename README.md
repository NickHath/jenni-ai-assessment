Technical assessment for Jenni AI - Nick Hathaway.

To run the app locally, run the following commands in the root directory of the app:
  - `yarn install`
  - `yarn dev`
  - `ts-node server/index.ts`

I was able to complete all of the requirements except for conflict resolution when concurrently editing the same document.
